                    As a multifaceted firm, we have been operating for close to a decade now. It all began in the year 2008 when I started with filling of application forms and processing visa applications for people to the U.S embassy in the Gambia. The saying that a journey of thousand miles begin with a step was at play but I did not realize it till of late. As I look at how far I’ve come, I really see that yes it just took a step to get to where I am today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The implementation of e-visa application by the U.S embassy was what brought about my preeminence in the business as at then. I was called upon by people from all works of life for my services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I buckled up and made up my mind to focus on application form filling and visa processing, I decided to expand my territory to other countries too: I plunged into processing European countries too most especially the Schengen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As at now, my specialty in study abroad program is focused on America and CANADA. We are on top of the list when it comes to CANADIAN and USA visa application process.

                <p>Our office is flooded with counselees 24/7.From the young to the elderly and sometimes parents with their children on how to tackle their Studies, business and many other issues. We have stood up against illegal migration (Backway) from the very first day we started this firm. A lot of potential youth that would have perished in the ocean or desert got saved through the thorough counselling service we offered them. A lot made up their minds not to take the risk of going on a straw-way journey. They buckled up and today they are in various countries throughout the five continents with legal traveling documents. Some that decided to stay have also excelled in businesses.
